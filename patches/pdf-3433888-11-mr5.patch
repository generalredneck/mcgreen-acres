+# GitLabCI template for Drupal projects.
+#
+# This template is designed to give any Contrib maintainer everything they need to test, without requiring modification.
+# It is also designed to keep up to date with Core Development automatically through the use of include files that can be centrally maintained.
+# As long as you include the project, ref and three files below, any future updates added by the Drupal Association will be used in your
+# pipelines automatically. However, you can modify this template if you have additional needs for your project.
+# The full documentation is on https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/gitlab_templates/
+################
+
+# For information on alternative values for 'ref' see https://project.pages.drupalcode.org/gitlab_templates/info/templates-version/
+# To test a Drupal 7 project, change the first include filename from .main.yml to .main-d7.yml
+include:
+  - project: $_GITLAB_TEMPLATES_REPO
+    ref: $_GITLAB_TEMPLATES_REF
+    file:
+      - '/includes/include.drupalci.main.yml'
